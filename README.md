# DDoS-SDN-Attack-Prediction
Creating an automated security framework based on Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to
handle slow-rate Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in real-time.
Deploying this framework on a physical network setup using equipment from the European
Experimental Facility Smart Networks for Industry (SN4I)
Assessing the framework's performance in diverse scenarios, such as varying numbers of
attackers and victims, to gauge its effectiveness in countering malicious connections.
Introducing the SDN-Slow Rate-DDoS dataset, which documents numerous experiments of
slow-rate DDoS attacks conducted on a real testbed, offering valuable real-world data for
research and development efforts.
Presenting concrete proof of the framework's efficiency and practicality in real-world
environments, thereby pushing forward the current standards in DDoS attack prevention and
bolstering the security resilience of network infrastructures against emerging threats.
